# Flower-Image-Classification-in-Tensor-Procesing-Unit

Identification and categorization of flower images are  active research problems in the field of Computer Vision.The ability to design a computer system to perform the same accurately would provide tremendous benefits in various social and commercial aspects of life like aesthetics,botanical taxonomy,pharmaceutical industry etc.In the last decade, this problem has been tackled by performing efficient feature engineering such as colour or texture extraction and subsequently by machine learning prediction on the basis of extracted features.In this project, a novel approach of solving this problem is taken by integrating and ensembling two efficiently scaled Deep Conventional Neural Network models namely EfficientNet and DenseNet.The training experiment is performed using large number of images from multiple public datasets on multiple complex deep neural network models. Therefore, to optimize the computational resource and efficiency,the experiment would be run on Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) hardware environment and the efficacy of the same would be assesed in terms of computational power and speed. 

The Notebook conists the python implementation of ensemble of Densenet and EfficientNet DNN models.
